# A list of files to be loaded into the REPL environment on startup.
# These classes can override built-in classes for Godot.
# Place each file on its own line.
# Make sure to give your script a `class_name` so it can be resolved
# For example, uncommenting this line will load the script at startup:
#res://path/to/my/class_file.gd
